                 Advertising Unreachable Links in OSPF
                draft-ietf-lsr-ospf-ls-link-infinity-02

Abstract

   In certain scenarios, it is necessary to advertise unreachable links
   in OSPF, which should be explicitly excluded from the related SPF
   calculation.  This document specifies using LSLinkInfinity(0xffff) to
   advertise an OSPF link as unreachable.

   Stub Router Advertisement (RFC 6987) defines MaxLinkMetric (0xffff)
   to indicate a router-LSA link should not be used for transit traffic.
   This document updates RFC 6987 and RFC 8770.  When an OSPFv2 router
   supports the Unreachable Link support capability defined in this
   document, the OSPFv2 stub router MaxLinkMetric(0xffff) MUST be
   updated to MaxReachableLinkMetric(0xfffe).

1.  Introduction

   In specific scenarios, there is a requirement to advertise
   unreachable links in OSPF, which MUST NOT be considered during the
   standard SPF computation.  For example, a link may be available for
   Traffic Engineering (TE) purposes but not suitable for hop-by-hop
   routing.  Another example is an OSPF link with dedicated resources
   for a network slice included in a Flexible Algorithm (Flex-
   Algorithm) but excluded from the default topology.

   This document proposes a mechanism to advertise infinity links in
   OSPF.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Use Cases

2.1.  Case 1: Traffic Engineering

   A network topology is shown in Figure 1.  There is a link available
   for Traffic Engineering between Node A and E.  If this link is used
   for SPF calculations, best-effort traffic will be routed on the link.

                                  TE Link
                                 ---------

                        Figure 1: Network Topology

2.2.  Case 2: Flexible Algorithm

   A network topology is shown in Figure 2.  The links between nodes A,
   B, C, and D are to be used exclusively for a flex-algorithm used for
   a specific network slice.  These links have an Extended
   Administrative Group (EAG) [RFC7308] attribute specifying the "red"
   color.

   Flex-Algorithm 128 is enabled on Nodes A, B, C, and D, with an EAG
   rule including "red" and the Metric-Type is designated to be a type
   other than the IGP metric.  Flex-Algorithm allows OSPF to compute the
   paths along the constrained topology.  The topology used by Flex-
   Algorithm 128 is shown in Figure 3.

                               A******C
                               *      *
                               *      *
                               *      *
                               B******D

                 Figure 3: Topology of Flex-Algorithm 128

   Flex-Algorithm 128 is used for routing particular flows, such as
   those for a network slice.  The "red" links used by Flex-Algorithm
   128 are sub-interfaces with dedicated queues for guaranteed
   bandwidth.  Sub-interfaces in other network slices and default
   topology are omitted from the example figure for clarity.  So, it is
   expected that only the particular flows are routed on these links
   using Flex-Algorithm 128.  However, these links are also contained in
   the default topology computed by the normal SPF calculation, and
   these links may also be used for best-effort traffic.  Therefore, it
   is a problem that the dedicated links for Flex-Algorithm are still
   reachable in base SPF calculation.

   If the IGP metrics for all the "red" links are advertised as
   unreachable, the base topology will be as shown in Figure 4,
   excluding all the "red" links.  This allows only the network slice
   traffic to be routed on the "red" links by Flex-Algorithm 128.

3.  Solution based on LSLinkInfinity

   This document specifies that if the IGP metric of a link is
   advertised as LSLinkInfinity (0xffff), it MUST NOT be considered
   during the related SPF computation.  This applies to both the Flex-
   Algorithm SPF and the base SPF as long as LSLinkInfinity is specified
   for the IGP metric.

4.  Backward Compatibility

4.1.  LSLinkInfinity Backward Compatibility

   Prior to this specification, OSPF treated links advertised as
   LSLinkInfinity as reachable [RFC2328].  Hence, partial deployment of
   this specification may result in routing loops due to inconsistent
   interpretation of LSLinkInfinity.  For example in the network shown
   in Figure 5, link D-F is advertised with
   LSLinkInfinity(65535/0xffff).  Router A supports LSLinkInfinity as
   unreachable, but router B does not.  Router A considers link D-F as
   reachable, and the shortest path to F is A->B->D->F.  Router B
   considers link D-F as unreachable, and the shortest path to F is
   B->A->C->E->F.  As a result, A forwards the packets to B, but B
   returns them to A, which results in a routing loop.

          40000  40000      Traffic: A->F
        A------C------E       A considers link D-F as reachable
        |             |         A's shortest path: A->B->D->F
       5|             |5      B considers link D-F as unreachable
        |             |         B's shortest path: B->A->C->E->F
        B------D------F
            5    65535

    Figure 5: Inconsistent LSLinkInfinity Interpretation Causing Loops

   To provide backward compatibility, this document defines that routers
   supporting LSLinkInfinity for unreachable links MUST advertise a
   Router Information (RI) LSA advertisement of a Router Informational
   Capabilities TLV [RFC7770] including the following Router
   Informational Capability Bit:

                    +=====+==========================+
                    | Bit | Capabilities             |
                    +=====+==========================+
                    | TBA | Unreachable Link support |
                    +-----+--------------------------+

                                 Table 1

   OSPF Routers MUST NOT treat links with an advertised metric of
   LSLinkInfinity as unreachable unless all routers in the OSPF area
   have advertised this capability.  If all OSPF Routers in the area
   have advertised this capability, then links with an advertised metric
   of LSLinkInfinity MUST be treated as unreachable.  Upon detection of
   a change in the number of routers in the area not supporting the
   Unreachable Link support capability changes to 0 or from 0 to greater
   than 0, all OSPF routers in the area MUST recalculate their routes.

   An IGP metic with LSLinkInfinity indicating a link is unreachable is
   applicable to the following TLVs/LSAs:

   *  The Router-LSA [RFC2328] and [RFC5340]

   *  The OSPFv2 Extended Link TLV of OSPFv2 Extended Link Opaque LSA
      [RFC7684]

   *  The Router-Link TLV of OSPFv3 E-Router-LSA [RFC8362]

4.2.  Stub Router Advertisement Backward Compatibility

   Stub Router Advertisement [RFC6987] defines MaxLinkMetric (0xffff) to
   indicate a router-LSA link should not be used for transit traffic.

   This document updates [RFC6987] and [RFC8770].  When an OSPFv2 router
   supports the Unreachable Link support capability defined in this
   document, the OSPFv2 stub router MaxLinkMetric(0xffff) MUST be
   updated to MaxReachableLinkMetric(0xfffe).

   When an OSPFv2 router supports [RFC6987] and the Unreachable Link
   support capability defined in this document, it MUST also support
   [RFC8770].  When announcing itself as a stub router, it MUST set the
   H-bit in the router-LSA and advertise all its non-stub links with a
   link cost of MaxReachableLinkMetric (0xfffe).  Since MaxLinkMetric
   will not be used to indicate a link is unreachable unless all OSPFv2
   routers in the area support this specification as specified in
   section 3, all routers in the area will also support the H-bit and
   the usage of MaxReachableLinkMetric to indicate an OSPF stub router
   link should not be used for transit traffic.

   An OSPFv3 router can simply use the R-bit [RFC5340] for stub router
   advertisement.

5.  Management Considerations

   Support of the Unreachable Link support capability SHOULD be
   configurable.

   In some networks, the operator may still want links with maximum
   metric(0xffff) to be treated as reachable.  For example, when auto-
   costing of links is used and there is a mix of low-speed and high-
   speed links.  In such cases, the updated routers can disable the
   Unreachable Link support capability and still treat links with
   maximum metric as reachable.

Internet-Draft    Advertising Unreachable Links in OSPF    December 2024


   It is also RECOMMENDED that implementations supporting this document
   and auto-costing limit the maximum computed cost to
   MaxReachableLinkMetric (0xfffe).

6.  Security Considerations

   The document does not introduce any new security issues for the OSPF
   protocol.  The security considerations for [RFC2328],[RFC5340],
   [RFC6987], and [RFC7770] are applicable to protocol extension.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new bit in the registry "OSPF Router
   Functional Capability Bits":

         +============+==========================+===============+
         | Bit Number | Capability Name          | Reference     |
         +============+==========================+===============+
         | 0(TBD)     | Unreachable Link support | This document |
         +------------+--------------------------+---------------+
