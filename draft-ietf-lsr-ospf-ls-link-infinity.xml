	In certain scenarios, it is necessary to advertise unreachable links
  in OSPF, which should be explicitly excluded from the related SPF
  calculation. This document specifies using LSLinkInfinity(0xffff) to
  advertise an OSPF link as unreachable.
</t>
<t>
  Stub Router Advertisement (RFC 6987) defines MaxLinkMetric (0xffff) 
  to indicate a router-LSA link should not be used for transit
  traffic. This document updates RFC 6987 and RFC 8770. When an 
  OSPFv2 router supports the Unreachable Link support capability 
  defined in this document, the OSPFv2 stub router 
  MaxLinkMetric(0xffff) MUST be updated to 
  MaxReachableLinkMetric(0xfffe).

      <t>
    In specific scenarios, there is a requirement to advertise
    unreachable links in OSPF, which MUST NOT be considered during the
    standard SPF computation. For example, a link may be available for
    Traffic Engineering (TE) purposes but not suitable for hop-by-hop
    routing. Another example is an OSPF link with dedicated resources
    for a network slice included in a Flexible Algorithm (Flex-
    Algorithm) but excluded from the default topology.
      </t>
      <t>
    This document proposes a mechanism to advertise infinity links in
    OSPF.

       Flex-Algorithm 128 is enabled on Nodes A, B, C, and D, with an EAG
       rule including "red" and the Metric-Type is designated to be a type
       other than the IGP metric. Flex-Algorithm allows OSPF to compute the
       paths along the constrained topology. The topology used by Flex-
       Algorithm 128 is shown in Figure 3.

        <t>
       Flex-Algorithm 128 is used for routing particular flows, such as
       those for a network slice. The "red" links used by Flex-Algorithm
       128 are sub-interfaces with dedicated queues for guaranteed
       bandwidth. Sub-interfaces in other network slices and default
       topology are omitted from the example figure for clarity. So, it is
       expected that only the particular flows are routed on these links
       using Flex-Algorithm 128. However, these links are also contained in
       the default topology computed by the normal SPF calculation, and
       these links may also be used for best-effort traffic. Therefore, it
       is a problem that the dedicated links for Flex-Algorithm are still
       reachable in base SPF calculation.
        </t>
        <t>
       If the IGP metrics for all the "red" links are advertised as
       unreachable, the base topology will be as shown in Figure 4,
       excluding all the "red" links. This allows only the network slice
       traffic to be routed on the "red" links by Flex-Algorithm 128.

    This document specifies that if the IGP metric of a link is
    advertised as LSLinkInfinity (0xffff), it MUST NOT be considered
    during the related SPF computation. This applies to both the Flex-
    Algorithm SPF and the base SPF as long as LSLinkInfinity is
    specified for the IGP metric.

        <t>
      Prior to this specification, OSPF treated links advertised as
      LSLinkInfinity as reachable <xref target="RFC2328"/>. Hence, partial deployment of
      this specification may result in routing loops due to inconsistent
      interpretation of LSLinkInfinity. For example in the network shown
      in Figure 5, link D-F is advertised with
      LSLinkInfinity(65535/0xffff). Router A supports LSLinkInfinity as
      unreachable, but router B does not. Router A considers link D-F as
      reachable, and the shortest path to F is A-&gt;B-&gt;D-&gt;F. Router B
      considers link D-F as unreachable, and the shortest path to F is
      B-&gt;A-&gt;C-&gt;E-&gt;F. As a result, A forwards the packets to B, but B
      returns them to A, which results in a routing loop.

       To provide backward compatibility, this document defines that
       routers supporting LSLinkInfinity for unreachable links MUST
       advertise a Router Information (RI) LSA advertisement of a Router
       Informational Capabilities TLV <xref target="RFC7770"/> including the following

       OSPF Routers MUST NOT treat links with an advertised metric of
       LSLinkInfinity as unreachable unless all routers in the OSPF area
       have advertised this capability. If all OSPF Routers in the area
       have advertised this capability, then links with an advertised
       metric of LSLinkInfinity MUST be treated as unreachable. Upon
       detection of a change in the number of routers in the area not
       supporting the Unreachable Link support capability changes to 0 or
       from 0 to greater than 0, all OSPF routers in the area MUST

      Stub Router Advertisement <xref target="RFC6987"/> defines MaxLinkMetric (0xffff)
      to indicate a router-LSA link should not be used for transit
      traffic.
        </t>
        <t>
      This document updates <xref target="RFC6987"/> and <xref target="RFC8770"/>. When an OSPFv2 router
      supports the Unreachable Link support capability defined in this
      document, the OSPFv2 stub router MaxLinkMetric(0xffff) MUST be
      updated to MaxReachableLinkMetric(0xfffe).
        </t>
        <t>
       When an OSPFv2 router supports <xref target="RFC6987"/> and the Unreachable Link
       support capability defined in this document, it MUST also support
       <xref target="RFC8770"/>. When announcing itself as a stub router, it MUST set the
       H-bit in the router-LSA and advertise all its non-stub links with a
       link cost of MaxReachableLinkMetric (0xfffe). Since MaxLinkMetric
       will not be used to indicate a link is unreachable unless all OSPFv2
       routers in the area support this specification as specified in
       section 3, all routers in the area will also support the H-bit and
       the usage of MaxReachableLinkMetric to indicate an OSPF stub router
       link should not be used for transit traffic.
        </t>
        <t>
       An OSPFv3 router can simply use the R-bit <xref target="RFC5340"/> for stub router
       advertisement.

    Support of the Unreachable Link support capability SHOULD be

    In some networks, the operator may still want links with maximum
    metric(0xffff) to be treated as reachable. For example, when auto-
    costing of links is used and there is a mix of low-speed and high-
    speed links. In such cases, the updated routers can disable the
    Unreachable Link support capability and still treat links with
    maximum metric as reachable.
      </t>
